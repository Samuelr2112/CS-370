# Pirate Intelligent Agent Project  

## Project Description  
This project was about building an intelligent pirate agent. It uses reinforcement learning and neural networks. The goal is for the agent to learn how to make better decisions over time.  

## My Work  
I was given a code framework for the environment. It had the simulation and templates. I wrote the code for the agent. I implemented the Q-learning algorithm. I made the neural network to help the agent learn and improve. I also worked on testing and debugging until the agent performed well.  

## How This Project Relates to Computer Science  
Computer scientists solve problems with technology. We write code, build systems, and design programs to make life easier or solve hard problems.  

I approached the problem step by step. First, I understood the environment. I focused on how the pirate agent moves and learns. Then I worked on the algorithm and neural network. Each small part built on the last to create a full solution.  

Computer scientists have a responsibility to do their work ethically. This means writing code that is fair, secure, and respects users. I kept this in mind by making sure my agent learned in a way that was efficient and reliable.
